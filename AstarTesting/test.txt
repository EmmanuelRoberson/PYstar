#Key
#G = Goal Node
#S = Start Node
#W = Non-walkable Node or Wall
#New test cases are identified with the ==> and after each value must follow a ; even the last 
#value in the line
#Test(number)=answer= is the correct path we expect to be returned after the algorithm has completed
#using '#' means this is a comment

#Test1
#Test to see if a path can be found when the nodes are three spaces apart
#and in the middle of them is a 1 x 3 impassable wall
==>G:47;S:43;W:35;W:45;W:55;
Test1=answer=<7,4><6,3><5,2><4,3><4,4><3,4>

#Test2
#Test to see if the nodes can travel from one corner to the another in this cases
#the start node is <0,0> and the goal node is <9,9>
==>G:99;S:0;
Test2=answer=<9,9><8,8><7,7><6,6><5,5><4,4><3,3><2,2><1,1><0,0>

#Test3
#Test if the goal node and start node are next to each other
#Testing to ensure the horizontal or vertical gscore is set properly
==>G:0;S:1;
Test3=answer=<0,0><1,0>

#Test4
#Test if the goal node and start node are next to each other
#Testing to ensure the diagonal gscore is set properly
==>G:0;S:11;
Test4=answer=<0,0><1,1>

#Test5
#Test if the start and goal node are the same
==>G:0;S:0;
Test5=answer=<0,0>
